After a bumpy road, along which I kept in mind [Jeff Leak's own worst (recent) experience](http://simplystatistics.org/2012/07/11/my-worst-recent-experience-with-peer-review/), we finally got our article on _[Time-Course Gene Set Analysis for Longitudinal Gene Expression Data](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1004310)_ published in _PLoS Computational Biology_, a very nice journal ! I am really happy about it, don't hesitate to check it out ! And there is the [TcGSA](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TcGSA/index.html) R package that goes with it.
