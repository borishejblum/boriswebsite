The American Statistical Association launched a new website [thisisstatistics](http://thisisstatistics.org) with general information on what being a statistician really means today. I often meet fearful looks when I meet people and present myself as a "biostatistician" (the key word being statistician here). Up to the point that I now generally say I work in "applied mathematics in medicine", before I drop the magical "big data" keyword in the necessary explanation following this title.

This website seems very easy to navigate, and I hope it will participate in the heat statistics are getting, being the [sexiest job this days](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/06/technology/06stats.html) !
