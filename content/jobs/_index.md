## Postdoctoral position(s) in the SISTM team:

  * Developping new gene set approach to achieve practical cellular proportion estimation from deconvolution of RNA-seq data
  * Methods for evaluating high-dimensional surrogates applied to gene expression data to predict vaccine response
  * Computational Bayes: scaling-up inference for Dirichlet process mixture models
