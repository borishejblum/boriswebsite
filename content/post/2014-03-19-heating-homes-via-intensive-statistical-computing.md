At Bordeaux University, we are quite lucky. I mean as computational consumers.

Indeed, we have access to a big CPU cluster, a mesocenter that has been build for all the researchers in the [Aquitaine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquitaine) area (in the south west of France). And it's a big one. It's named avakas, and it has brought my Ph.D. computational projects to an other scale !

But for a few month now, I have also been granted access (for free as a I work in a national research agency) to a new kind of big computer: a net of heaters. That's right. This [Qarnot](http://www.qarnot-computing.com/) company has developped electrical radiators that encompass CPUs and are connected to internet. This is so cool (and it works) !

`foreach` here I come, bringing the heat !
