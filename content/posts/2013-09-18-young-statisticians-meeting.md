At the end of august 2013, I was lucky enough to attend the [_Rencontres des jeunes statisticiens_ (young statisticians meeting)](http://rencontres-jeunes-statisticiens.sfds.asso.fr/). It is organised every other year by the [_Société Française de Statistique_ (French Statistical Society)](http://www.sfds.asso.fr/). It was thrilling to meet all these [fellow statisticians in the making](http://rencontres-jeunes-statisticiens.sfds.asso.fr/Programme-RJS-2013-1bis.pdf)!

A lot of the talks were very interesting. In particular, one made me think of a recent [post](http://simplystatistics.org/2013/08/28/evidence-based-data-analysis-treading-a-new-path-for-reproducible-research-part-2/) from [Roger Peng](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~rpeng/) on the famous [Simply Statistics](http://simplystatistics.org) blog. [Benjamin Guedj](http://www.lsta.upmc.fr/doct/guedj/index.html) developed [a nonlinear aggregation strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.2236), an approach aggregating different solutions (from different modeling) to a regression problem. It is implemented as an R package, [COBRA](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/COBRA/index.html), and it seems to performs quite good (and fast). Even though I suspect it might choke a little on difficult datasets (n<<p anyone?), I find it quite clever. And, relating to R. Peng post, it has the advantage of reducing the "researcher degrees of freedom". Could it be a first step towards a [deterministic statistical machine](http://simplystatistics.org/2012/08/27/a-deterministic-statistical-machine/)?
