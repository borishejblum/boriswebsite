Yesterday I attended a conference on the [Horizons of Statistics](http://horizons.sfds.asso.fr/) at the [Henri Poincaré Institute](http://www.ihp.fr/en) in Paris, organized by the [French Statistical Association](http://www.sfds.asso.fr/). As it was [broadcasted on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9kd4mpdvWcAqVoyH3EGUlBefEfwlTYdP), this reminded me of the [Future Of Statistics unconference](http://simplystatistics.org/unconference/) organized by the simply statistics blog earlier in 2013 fall. By the way I really enjoyed [Daniela Witten](http://www.biostat.washington.edu/%7Edwitten/) talk from this unconference: [check it out](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4UJjzuYjfM#t=695) !

The Horizons of Statistics turned out very interesting, and I really enjoyed Emmanuel Candès [talk on randomized computing algorithms](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUmB5V5rCSg&list=PL9kd4mpdvWcAqVoyH3EGUlBefEfwlTYdP&index=2), as well as [Emmanuel Todd ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Todd)[talk which was very refreshing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1am5nf9Ponc&list=PL9kd4mpdvWcAqVoyH3EGUlBefEfwlTYdP&index=6) at the end of the day. Unfortunately those talks are only in French. But if you are an English speaker, you can [watch Robert N. Rodriguez](http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL9kd4mpdvWcAqVoyH3EGUlBefEfwlTYdP&feature=player_detailpage&v=ikHuTb3BUD0#t=110), who is very hopeful for young statistcians, such as myself, and for our profession in general !

All in all, it seems that the Horizons of Statistics are many, and all of them are looking bright !
