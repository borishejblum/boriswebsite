# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Ebola virus disease is a severe hemorrhagic fever with a high fatality rate. We investigate transcriptome profiles at 3 h, 1 day, and 7 days after vaccination with Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo. 3 h after Ad26.ZEBOV injection, we observe an increase in genes related to antigen presentation, sensing, and T and B cell receptors. The highest response occurs 1 day after Ad26.ZEBOV injection, with an increase of the gene expression of interferon-induced antiviral molecules, monocyte activation, and sensing receptors. This response is regulated by the HESX1, ATF3, ANKRD22, and ETV7 transcription factors. A plasma cell signature is observed on day 7 post-Ad26.ZEBOV vaccination, with an increase of CD138, MZB1, CD38, CD79A, and immunoglobulin genes. We have identified early expressed genes correlated with the magnitude of the antibody response 21 days after the MVA-BN-Filo and 364 days after Ad26.ZEBOV vaccinations. Our results provide early gene signatures that correlate with vaccine-induced Ebola virus glycoprotein-specific antibodies."
