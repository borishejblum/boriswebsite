On March 6th, 2015, I defended my thesis in front of a[ prestigious jury,](http://edsp2.u-bordeaux.fr/images/HEJBLUM_B.Affiche_soutenance-1.pdf) and was awarded the title of Ph.D. in Public Health with a concentration in Biostatistics (_Docteur en Santé Publique — option Biostatistique_) from the[ University of Bordeaux](http://www.u-bordeaux.com/). After more than 3 years of hard work, that's an incredible feeling. For the interested reader, [My Ph.D. thesis](https://borishejblum.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/hejblum_2015bord0049_oneside_light3.pdf) !
