# Hi, I'm Boris !

I am a University teacher and a researcher in biostatistics. This website is both a personal website and a blog !

Broadly speaking, my main research focus is on the longitudinal analysis of high-dimensional biomedical data. My latest projects include gene set analysis of longitudinal gene expression, Bayesian nonparametric modeling of longitudinal flow-cytometry data and anonymous probabilistic patient record linkage in high-dimension.

I am currently a tenured associate professor (*Maître de Conférences*) at the [Bordeaux School of Public Health](http://www.isped.u-bordeaux.fr/en-us/accueil.aspx) from the [University of Bordeaux](http://www.u-bordeaux.com/), while my research activities are fostered by the [SISTM team](http://www.bordeaux-population-health.center/en/teams/statistics-in-systems-biology-and-translationnal-medicine-sistm/) from both [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en/teams/sistm) and [INSERM](http://english.inserm.fr/) institutes, in the [U1219 Bordeaux population health center](http://www.bordeaux-population-health.center/en/). Previously I did a postdoc with [Tianxi Cai](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/tianxi-cai/)  at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. Before that I did my  Ph.D. in [Public Health](http://edsp2.u-bordeaux.fr/) - [Biostatistics](http://www.bordeaux-population-health.center/en/teams/biostatistics/) at [ISPED](http://www.isped.u-bordeaux.fr/) in Bordeaux, France, under the supervision of [François Caron](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~caron/) and [Rodolphe Thiébaut](https://www.bordeaux-population-health.center/profile/rodolphe-thiebaut/). I graduated from the [ENSAI](http://www.ensai.fr/) (National School for Statistics and Information Analysis — part of the very French [_Grandes Écoles_ system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandes_%C3%A9coles)) in 2011, where I majored in Biostatistics. In case you would want to learn more about my curriculum, please go see my [CV ](https://borishejblum.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/cvnov2016_bh1.pdf)or check my [LinkedIn profile](http://fr.linkedin.com/pub/boris-hejblum/38/34b/879/en).
