# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Bayesian mixture models are increasingly used for model-based clustering and the follow-up analysis on the clusters identified. As such, they are of particular interest for analyzing cytometry data where unsupervised clustering and association studies are often part of the scientific questions. Cytometry data are large quantitative data measured in a multi-dimensional space that typically ranges from a few dimensions to several dozens, and which keeps increasing due to innovative high-throughput biotechonologies. We present several recent parametric and nonparametric Bayesian mixture modeling approaches, and describe advantages and limitations of these models under different research context for cytometry data analysis. We also acknowledge current computational challenges associated with the use of Bayesian mixture models for analysing cytometry data, and we draw attention to recent developments in advanced numerical algorithms for estimating large Bayesian mixture models, which we believe have the potential to make Bayesian mixture model more applicable to new types of single-cell data with higher dimensions."
